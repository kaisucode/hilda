## Description / Theme
- A stylized scenary (eg. fantasy) that contains a generated fractal terrain. The user would be able to move around the scene with arrow or WASD keys, and high-dynamic-range rendering would be applied to the objects in the scene. 
- (disclaimer: no collision detection would be applied to the character)

## Technical features
- Stylized rendering
- HDR, perhaps with bloom
- (Fractal?) terrain
- Basic camera movement

### Potential features
- Move the camera or objects in the scene along a path defined as a piecewise Bezier curve, for example to render a ride on a roller coaster
- Fractals
- Computer generated art
